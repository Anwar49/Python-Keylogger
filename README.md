Keylogger Project

Description:
This project demonstrates a simple keylogger built with Python using the pynput library. The program logs key presses and records them into a log.txt file, including timestamps every 5 seconds if a key is pressed after that interval.

Features:
Logs all key presses except modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt).
Replaces special keys with human-readable labels (e.g.<Enter>, <Space>).
Records timestamps when at least 10 seconds have passed since the last logged key.
